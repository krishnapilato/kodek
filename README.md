## Project Status: Active Development üößüèóÔ∏èüî®

This project is currently under active development. I am working hard to build a robust and secure application, but please be aware of the following:

* **Security:** Security configurations are still being implemented and fine-tuned. While I am taking measures to protect user data, I recommend not using this application with sensitive information until the security features are complete.
* **Frontend:** Some frontend components are in an early stage of development. You might encounter bugs, responsiveness inconsistencies, or incomplete features. I appreciate your patience as I continue to improve the UI and UX.
* **Testing:** Thorough testing is ongoing, and I encourage you to report any issues you find through the [Issues tab](https://github.com/krishnapilato/portfolio/issues).

I welcome any feedback and contributions from the community as I work to bring this project to its full potential. Thank you for your understanding!

## Deployment
