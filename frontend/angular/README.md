# Angular Portfolio Project âœ¨

## ðŸš€ Get Started

1. **Fire up the development server:**
   - Open your terminal and run `ng serve -o`. This will open your project in your browser at `http://localhost:4200/`. 
   - Any changes you make to your code will automatically update the page â€“ it's like magic! âœ¨

2. **Build Your Dream Portfolio:**
   - Need a new page? A cool feature? Angular CLI has got you covered:
      - Run `ng generate component my-new-page` to whip up a new page component.
      - Want something else? Try `ng generate directive`, `ng generate pipe`, `ng generate service`, and more. The Angular CLI is your trusty sidekick!

3. **Ready to Share Your Work?**
   - When your portfolio is polished and ready to impress, run `ng build`. This will create a production-ready version of your project in the `dist/` folder, ready for the world to see.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Time

- **Unit Testing:**  Make sure everything is working smoothly under the hood by running `ng test`. This runs unit tests to check the individual parts of your code.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Test the entire user experience with `ng e2e`. You'll need to add a testing library like Cypress or Protractor first, though.

## ðŸ’¡ Need Help?

- **Angular CLI is Your Friend:** The Angular CLI is packed with features.  Run `ng help` or check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) to unlock its full potential.

Let your creativity flow, and build an amazing portfolio that truly represents you! ðŸŽ¨
